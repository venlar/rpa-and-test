# MY TEST AUTOMATION & RPA PROJECTS
This repository contains my test automation projects that I have done in order to improve my skills. You can learn more about my projects below:

# Skincare project
This is my first Robot Framework project. I wanted a quick way to check if my favorite skincare product is in stock on any of the websites I frequently use.

# Vuejs-crud project
Vuejs-crud is a CRUD project created by @paulund.
I created test cases for adding a product, updating a product, deleting a product and searching for products.
